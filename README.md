Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an exaggerated reaction of the body to an infection, that leads to organ failure or even death. Since sepsis can kill a patient even in just one hour, survival prediction is an urgent priority among the medical community: even if laboratory tests and hospital analyses can provide insightful information about the patient, in fact, they might not come in time to allow medical doctors to recognize an immediate death risk and treat it properly.
The project aims to understand whether sepsis has some correlation with the variable considered in the project, such as: sex, age and septic episode number. Find all the results in the attached files.
